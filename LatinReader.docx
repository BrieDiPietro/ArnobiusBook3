Reading an Ancient Language
	Reading an ancient language is hard. The best way to begin this process is to understand that you are learning how to read all over again. This time will probably take a bit more effort because you haven’t been exposed to this one before.
	With that said, it’s rewarding. There is nothing like the pride you feel as you grow from looking at a page of gibberish to fluently reading an ancient text.
	Be patient as you start to work your way through short clauses. Try to stay calm as you begin to struggle through sentences. Even when it seems impossible, you can get through the phrases, the sentences, the paragraphs, and the stories.
