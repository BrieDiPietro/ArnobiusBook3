Headings and Descriptions

*3.2.1-3.3.2: In Him We Worship All Gods*
The Christian God is the head of all possible gods that could exist. Therefore, in the worship of the First God, Christians worship any god that could exist. It is the same as respecting a king. Anyone connected the king also feels this respect.

*3.4: Who Are the Pagan Gods?*
The Pagans cannot possibly know who their gods are. They have never seen the heavens or the supposed gods. Moreover, even if the Pagans worship gods that do exist, they couldn't possibly know their names.

*3.5: How Many Pagan Gods are There?*
If it is conceded that all of the Pagan gods do exist, it would be impossible to know that there are not more gods unknown to them. It is impossible to know if there is even a finite number of gods. If the Pagans then ignore some number of gods, the Christians are no different in their worship of only one.

*3.6: You Invented Shameful Pagan Gods in Your Stories*
Pagans created gods in a shameful manner by assigning them genders in their many stories. Romans and Greeks have spoken this way for a long while. Even Cicero agrees to this point, which Pagans would know if they read Cicero's work rather than simply appreciating his rhetoric.

*3.8: The Christian God Doesn't Have a Sex*
Pagans may put forth that Christians believe their god to belong to the male gender, but this is incorrect. The Christian god only has a masculine name. If the gods actually had gender they would be differentiated by sexual organs. These organs have only been created for intercourse and reproduction.

*3.9.1-3.9.2: The Heavens Must Be Full*
If the gods have these organs created for reproduction and are immortal, the number of gods would be constantly multiplying. At no point do the gods tire or grow weary of reproduction, so the heavens must be filled. If the gods don't reproduce, then there is no reason for them to be distinguished in the way of sexual organs.

*3.9.3: The Pagan Gods Have Useless Parts*
Each body part is created for a purpose. Without the need for reproduction, these sexual organs are useless.

*3.10.1-3.10.3: Do the Pagan Gods have the Disgraces Associated with Sex?*
If the gods do have these sexual organs, they must have the disgraces associated with them. They must fall into the passions of sex. They must become exhausted after having sex. The women must experience periods, have morning sickness, and give birth prematuraly.

*3.10.3-3.10.5: Do the Pagan Gods have the Emotions Associated with Sex?*
Lust looks to see improper things. It burns after seeing the gods naked, aroused, pregnant, in pain, and calling out to Juno Lucina in birthing. Giving this lust to the gods is considered piety.

*3.12-3.14.2: The Pagan Gods Have Physical Forms*
Even worse than giving the gods these disgraces is to show them in human forms. The pagan gods are presented having a head, teeth, muscles, bones, and further physical features. This is only the beginning. If the outside of the gods are human, they must also have internal organs. If they don't eat mortal food it follows that they wouldn't have teeth. Then, maybe they don't have the internal organs for eating. They are just skin on an inflated form. With all of these physical forms, you must wonder if the gods then look alike or different. If they are alike in shape, would they not make mistakes in recognition?

*3.14.2-3.15: The Pagan Gods Must Have Physical Differences*
The gods must look different from one another. They must have different hair colors and facial features. In fact, in your presentation, you show them as such. It takes a man without reason to think the gods have age or hair of any kind. Does that then mean that there are barbers or other gods holding professions for cosmetics? This is disgraceful. Pagans make fun of Egyptians for worshiping absurd images, but they do the same thing in worshiping these human images as though they hold divinity.

*3.16: You Insult the Pagan Gods*
In giving the gods human forms the Pagans insult them. Even if done in attempted reverence, it still shows a complete lack of piety. Comparatively, humans would be enraged if animals were to worship us in their forms. The Pagan gods must be furious with their followers, that is if they are capable of experiencing such an emotion.

*3.17-3.19: We Don't and Can't Know God's Form*
There is no way for human speech to explain God. Christians don't know what God looks like, but they take no shame in not knowing what they have never seen. The same goes for the qualities of God. It makes no sense to explain God as good or upright, for these are mortal descriptions unfitting for God. He may see or hear or experience the world, but it cannot be in the same way that mortals do.

*3.24-3.25: Do the Pagan Gods Need Worship to Act?*
It seems as though the gods do not act until they see sacrifices or hear prayers. This would not be a divinity of kindness, but one selling their own powers. It seems more likely that the gods give freely, for the wicked and holy receive the same weather and blessing. Then, why are they named and worshipped so absurdly? Gods exist for each action and are named as such. Without the worship of their followers, would there not be names for the gods?

*3.26-3.28: Complications with the God Mars*
Mars has power over wars. If he works to end wars, why do wars continue? If he works to start wars, is it fitting to worship a god that heaps bodies on a battlefield for nothing more than his pleasure?

Pagans worship gods known for their gentleness, a trait that can be taught to cattle. "Either in very truth they are gods and do not do the things you tell about them or, if they do what you say, without any doubt they are not gods."

*3.29: Your Ideas Result in the Elimination of Gods*
First, you disagree on your gods. In trying to stand higher than one another you replace god after god. Further, many gods are simply the names of measurements. All of these are then removed as gods. For example, Janus is known as the sun, the world, and the year. In reality Janus is a fixed measure of time, he could not possibly be a god.

*3.36: You Are Responsible for the Anger of the Pagan Gods*
****need help understanding this argument****

*3.42-3.43: The Individuality and Specific Rituals of Pagan Gods are Imperfect*
There is absolutely no consistency in the beliefs in the gods. How is one to know who to invoke or how to invoke if there are uncertainties? More, they require specific rituals. If some details are incorrect, or rather unclear, how could the gods hear my own prayers?

*3.44: The Lack of Consistency and Great Uncertainty Make the Pagan Gods Void*
The Pagans are not certain in anything about their gods. A god must either be understood and agreed upon or his existence must be doubted.
