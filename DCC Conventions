- A summary of the specific types of multimedia enhancements envisioned, whether audio, video, maps, images, or something else, and how those might be created, or from what sources drawn. Images are particularly welcome, but must be annotated to make clear their relevance and relationship to the text. How will those annotations be created?
- A statement of what collaborators, if any, the editor can bring on board to help complete the work. These might include students, colleagues, or web developers at the authorâ€™s institution, or elsewhere. Please note any grants for which you might apply to speed the work.
